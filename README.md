# overlux
overlux is a simple scripting language that helps build faster using a tranx form which transforms overlux to PHP. It has syntax similar to Python and this is to enable easy learning and understanding of how it works. Overlux would be the first to be build from another scripting language, all thanks to https://www.php.net
